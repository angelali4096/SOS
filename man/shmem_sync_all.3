.SS API Description

The 
.B shmem\_sync\_all
routine registers the arrival of a PE at a
barrier. Barriers are a fast mechanism for synchronizing all PEs at
once. This routine blocks the PE until all PEs have called
.BR "shmem\_sync\_all" .
In a multithreaded OpenSHMEM
program, only the calling thread is blocked.

In contrast with the 
.B shmem\_barrier\_all
routine,
.B shmem\_sync\_all
only ensures completion and visibility of previously issued memory
stores and does not ensure completion of remote memory updates issued via
OpenSHMEM routines.

.SS Return Values

None.

.SS API Notes

The 
.B shmem\_sync\_all
routine can be used to portably ensure that
memory access operations observe remote updates in the order enforced by the
initiator PEs, provided that the initiator PE ensures completion of remote
updates with a call to 
.B shmem\_quiet
prior to the call to the
.B shmem\_sync\_all
routine.
